### React Router cheatsheet

## Description

Based on the yt tutorial Dave Gray. Video is outdated, but the concept of the website is right for the project. Read the documentation listed in "Useful links" section

-   To make sure that "Link" and "Route" nested inside "Routes" will work, we have to make them both inside the same "BrowserRouter"
-   useNavigate(); //have to be inside "BrowserRouter"
